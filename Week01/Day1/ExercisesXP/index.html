    <h1 id="Lions">The lions</h1>
    <hr />
    Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
    savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than
    other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at
    twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and
    cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions,
    depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when hunting
    and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra
    and even giraffe.
